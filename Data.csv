Five traders were selected for the storage trial. The storage structures and condition of many small-scale traders operating in Tamale market are poor. The traders store bagged cowpea for up to 5 months. Individual traders may store up as much as 30 to 40 tons in sacks. PHLs incurred may reach 70% in 7 months when storage protectants are not used. When protectants are used, PHLs could reach 20% within the same period. As innovation to reduce the losses, a system that allowed an integrated approach to grain protection was developed, which included improvements to stores, practicing good store hygiene, fumigating the produce before storing or use of residual insecticides.","Field Trial","Golob et al., (1999)","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/285594317_Postharvest_losses_in_Africa_-_Analytical_review_and_synthesis_the_case_of_Ghana"

damage makes the fruit unmarketable. The placement of wrapped bananas on motorbikes and trucks
caused physical injuries which affected the fingers on the outer row of the hands. After ripening the
bruised area becomes hardened and creates avenues for entry of pathogens. Since bananas are climacteric,
injury to the fruit causes ethylene production, increases respiration and water loss thereby
shortening postharvest life. Additionally, decay caused by pathogenic agents' sets in at the point of
injury","","","","Rapid Assessment","Kitinoja and Cantwell (2010)","http://www.fao.org/fileadmin/user_upload/save-food/PDF/Kenya_Food_Loss_Studies.pdf"
